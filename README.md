# Neural Netwok
An Neural Network Libary, made completely from scratch using numpy and plain python, loosely based on [this article](https://towardsdatascience.com/math-neural-network-from-scratch-in-python-d6da9f29ce65).

## Implimentations
### MNIST
implimented with both a Fully Connected Neural netowork ([mnist.py](mnist.py)) and a convolutional neural network ([mnist_conv.py](mnist_conv.py))

### Diffusion Model
coming soon, waiting on implimentation of a uNet and an efficient ConvNet, forward diffusion is implimented in [network/diffusion.py](network/diffusion.py)

## Supported Architectures 
- Plain Neural Networks
- Convolutional Neural Networks
- Diffusion Models (coming soon)
