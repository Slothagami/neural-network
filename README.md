# Neural Netwok
An Neural Network Libary, made completely from scratch in C.

### C TODO (Short term)
- make nn libary (standard FC model)
- connect back to python? to load datasets and use its interface
- ConvNet

### C TODO (Long)
- loading, and automatic saving, of trained models
- Convolutional Layers
- Softmax
- Sigmoid Activation
- ReLU Activation
- Categorical Cross Entropy loss
- update pooling layer for multiple color channels
- UNets
- Diffusion Models
