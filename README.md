A machine learning libary, made completely from scratch.

<br></br>
### Upcoming Milestones
- Mnist capable
    - python wrapper
- Mnist proficient
    - convolutional layers
    - reshape layer
    - pooling layer
    - save/load of trained models (and their layers)
        - don't allocate memory for delta_weights and delta_biases in models loaded for prediction only (2x memory use for no reason, as they are only used in training)
