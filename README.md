# Neural Netwok
An Neural Network Libary, made completely from scratch using python and C. My aim is to create a diffusion model to generate images completely from zero.

### C TODO (Short term)
- polish and optimize matrix.c
- make a nn libary (standard FC model)
- connect back to python? to load datasets and use its interface
- ConvNet in C

### C TODO (Long)
- loading, and automatic saving, of trained models
- Fully Connected Layers
- Convolutional Layers
- Softmax
- Sigmoid Activation
- Tanh Activation
- ReLU Activation
- Custom layer types (inherits `Layer`)
- Custom Activations and Loss functions (inherits `NNFunction`)
- Mean Squared Error loss
- Categorical Cross Entropy loss
- update pooling layer for multiple color channels
- convert modules to C for speed?
- UNets
- Diffusion Models
