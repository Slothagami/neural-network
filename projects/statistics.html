        <h1> Statistics </h1>

        <p>
            Statistics is our way of describing properties of a large group using
            only some of its members. This is useful in surveys and experiments 
            where you can't get acess to every member of a group.
        </p>
        <p>
            In this interactive article, we will explain and visualize these concepts
            using data that you choose, at the moment it is full of random numbers.

        <h2>Mean and Standard Deviation</h2>
        <p>
            The mean is another word for "average". The average of the data 
            can be thought of as the "average sample" that you'd expect if you 
            picked one on average. For this reason it is also called the expected 
            value.
