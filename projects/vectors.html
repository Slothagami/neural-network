        <h1>Vectors</h1>
        <p>
            Vectors have lots of applications, from raytracing to predicting the paths of objects in physics. They can 
            be considered the link between numbers and pictures, and can be a powerful visualisaion tool for a wide range of topics.
            Let this be your visual guide to the properties of vectors
            and the ideas around them.
        </p>

        <h2>Lines</h2>
        <p>
            Vector lines are defined parametrically in terms of another 
            variable, usually \(t\). Vector lines work exactly the same 
            as normal linear equations. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Start with any vector \(\color{#5492f0}{\vec{c}}\). This point defines the position of
            the line (where it starts). The is now a vector \(\color{#F09B24}{\vec{v}}\), and indicates the 
            direction of the line. You can represent this as the equation 
            \( line(t) = \color{#F09B24}{\vec{v}t} + \color{#5492f0}{\vec{c}} \), shown below. As you vary the parameter
            \( t \), notice that the tip of the vector traces out a line.
        </p>
        <canvas id="line"></canvas>
        <div id="line-controls">
            <input id="line-scale" class="orange" type="range" min="-4" max="4" value="1" step=".1">
        </div>
        <p>
            Because the slope \(\color{#F09B24}{\vec{v}}\) is scaled up and down to trace the line,
            it doesn't matter what the length of the original vector is, as it 
            still traces the same line, but just with a different speed.
        </p>

        <h2>Colinear Vectors</h2>
        <p>
            Colinear refers to Vectors that lie on the same line. The line they 
            all lie on does not necessarily pass through the origin. Below is 
            an example of vectors that are all colinear.
        </p>
        <canvas id="colinear"></canvas>
        <p>
            You can show this algebraically by comparing the slope of the line
            between any two vectors. If the direction of the two slopes are the same,
            you have shown the vectors to be colinear.
        </p>


        <h2>Linear Dependance</h2>
        <p>
            linear dependance extends the idea of colinearity. a set of vectors are
            linearly independant if there are no "redundant" vectors in the set that 
            don't help you reach new points. So theese vectors below linearly 
            <b>in</b>dependant, since they all point in new directions, and allow 
            acess to new points. Drag around the white point and convince yourself that 
            you can indeed reach every point with just these two vectors.
        </p>
        <canvas id="linear_dependance_2d"></canvas>
        <p>
            if you were to add another 2d vector to this group, you could always make 
            it using the other two, so the vectors would not be all linearly independant
            anymore. If you added a 3d vector, it would extend the reach of the vectors, 
            and they would still be independant, as you could now acess more points in the 
            \(z\) axis that you couldn't using only the two shown above.
        </p>


        <h2>Notation</h2>
        <p>
            Before we continue, it will be helpful to know some notation.
            Vectors are usually written with an arrow or some other marking on
            them (for example \(\vec{a}\)) to indicate that they are a vector 
            and not a normal number. this is not nescecary, but helps keep things clear.
        </p>
        <p>
            Vectors can be represented algebraically in terms 
            of the unit vectors, \( \hat{i} \), \( \hat{j} \) and \( \hat{k} \).
            These are special vectors called "basis vectors". They define the 
            direction of each axis, and the size of a "unit". A vector with 
            cordinates \(x\), \(y\) andn \(z\) is written as 
            \( x \hat{i} + y \hat{j} + z \hat{k} \).
        </p>
        <p>
            The length of a vector \(\vec{v}\) is written as \(|\vec{v}|\) and is calculated with the
            pythagorean theorem.
            The hat symbol above each basis vector indicates that it is a unit 
            vector, meaning it has a length of 1.
        </p>


        <h2>Dot Product</h2>
        <p>
            $$ \color{#5492f0}{\vec{a}} \cdot \color{#F09B24}{\vec{b}} = |\color{#5492f0}{\vec{a}}||\color{#F09B24}{\vec{b}}|\cos{\theta} = \color{#5492f0}{a_{x}}\color{#F09B24}{b_{x}} + \color{#5492f0}{a_{y}}\color{#F09B24}{b_{y}} $$
            The dot product, denoted "\(\color{#5492f0}{\vec{a}} \cdot \color{#F09B24}{\vec{b}} \)" is a measure of alignment of vectors.
            it is equal to zero when the two vectors are perpendicular and negative when they 
            are opposing. It gives a larger value the closer the two vectors are aligned. You can 
            also rearrange this formula to calculate the angle between the vectors.
        </p>
        <canvas id="dot_prod"></canvas>


        <h2>Projection</h2>
        <p>
            It is sometimes useful to project one vector onto another. this is a way 
            of decomposing a vector into two perpendicular components. This is useful,
            for example, when calculating forces down a ramp in physics.
        </p>
        <p>
            In this example we will be projecting the vector \(\color{#F09B24}{\vec{a}}\) onto \(\color{#5492f0}{\vec{b}}\),
            in order to find vector \(\color{#18A340}{\vec{c}}\), as shown below.
        </p>
        <canvas id="proj_diagram"></canvas>
        <p>
            Thanks to trigonomerty, we know that the length of \(\color{#18A340}{\vec{c}}\) is 
            \(|\color{#F09B24}{\vec{a}}|\cos{\theta}\). We can normalize \(\color{#5492f0}{\vec{b}}\) and use the 
            dot product to find this value, and we find that \( |\color{#18A340}{\vec{c}}| = \color{#F09B24}{\vec{a}} \cdot \color{#5492f0}{\hat{b}} \)
        </p>
        <p>
            We can now scale \(\color{#5492f0}{\vec{b}}\) to have the correct length, and we have found 
            our projection. 
        </p>
        <p class="math">
            $$ \color{#18A340}{\vec{c}} = (\color{#F09B24}{\vec{a}} \cdot \color{#5492f0}{\hat{b}})\color{#5492f0}{\hat{b}} $$
        </p>
        <p>
            we can also find the other component of this decomposition \(\vec{d}\) (the dotted line)
            by subtracting from \(\color{#F09B24}{\vec{a}}\). and we find that:
        </p>
        <p class="math">
            $$ \vec{d} = \color{#F09B24}{\vec{a}} - \color{#18A340}{\vec{c}} $$
        </p>

        <!-- <h2>Cross Product</h2>
        <p>
            Is inherently 3D, generates perpendicular vectors, show way to 
            find determinant
        </p> -->
        <!-- Planes defined with a normal and their cartesian form -->


        <h2>Differentiation & Integration</h2>
        <p>
            Differentiating a variable valued function is the same as differentiating 
            each of its components. this is because you can split up each component 
            of the vector into a sum of the bases. this means you can differentiate 
            each term on its own using a scalar derivative. The same idea applies to 
            integration.
        </p>
        <p class="math">
            $$ \vec{r}(t) = x(t) \hat{i} + y(t) \hat{j} + z(t) \hat{k} $$

        <canvas id="derivative"></canvas>

            <input id="derivative-dt" type="range" min=".001" max=".4" value=".2" step=".001">

                \color{#d43cd4}{\frac{ d\vec{r} }{ dt }} = 
                \frac{ \color{#18A340}{d\vec{r}} }{ \color{#8a8a8a}{dt} } = 
                \frac{ \color{#5492f0}{dx} }{ \color{#8a8a8a}{dt} }\hat{i} + 
                \frac{ \color{#F09B24}{dy} }{ \color{#8a8a8a}{dt} }\hat{j} + 
                \frac{ dz }{ \color{#8a8a8a}{dt} }\hat{k} 
            $$
        </p>


        <h3>Arc Length and Area</h3>
        <p>
            Arc Length is found by approximating the curve using straight 
            segments, and adding up the length of each segment to get the 
            approximate length. This approximation is better for smaller values
            of \(dt\), and in the limit is equal to the actual length. You 
            can see below the segments more accurately folow the line the smaller
            \(dt\) is.

        </div>
        <p class="math">
            $$ 
                length = 
                \int  \biggl| \color{#F09B24}{ \frac{ d\vec{r} }{ dt } } \biggr| \color{#8a8a8a}{dt} = 
                \int  \sqrt{ \dot{x}(t)^2 + \dot{y}(t)^2 + \dot{z}(t)^2 } \color{#8a8a8a}{dt} 
            $$

            Areas are under a graph are found using rectangles as normal, 
            but now the width of the rectangles is not a constant, and depends
            on the horizontal velocity at that point.
