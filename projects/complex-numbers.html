        <h1>Complex Numbers</h1>
        <p>
            Complex numbers are often noted as the "link between algebra and geometry".
            They provide intuitive explanations for complicated ideas, and give
            rise to some of the most beautiful mathematical structures.
        </p>

        <p>
            The key to complex numbers is to visualize numbers as vectors, and 
            operations, such as addition or multiplication, as movement.
        </p>

        <canvas id="real_numbers"></canvas>
        <div id="real_numbers-controls" class="centered">
            <button id="real_numbers-negate">\(\times(-1)\)</button>
            <button id="real_numbers-add">\(+1\)</button>
            <button id="real_numbers-sub">\(-1\)</button>
        </div>

        <p>
            Addition and subtraction work as movement in a direction. 
            Multiplication works as rotating the number around <i>by 
            the angle of that number</i>. If you were to multiply by 
            a positive number, there is no rotation, because positive numbers 
            have an angle of 0. When you multiply by a negative, you rotate by 
            180 degrees. This is the reason that a negative times a negative 
            makes a positive.
        </p>
        <p>
            But its quite restrictive to rotate only by 180 degrees. Now we know
            to interpret multiplication as a rotation, how can you rotate by 
            some other ammount? What we need is a number that we can multiply by 
            that rotates us only 90 degrees, half of a negative.
        </p>
        <p>
            We can figure out what such a number needs to be by noticing a certain 
            fact about rotation. If you rotate by 90 degrees, and then do it again, 
            the effect is the same as rotating 180 degrees.
        </p>
        <p>
            Using this idea we can write that any number multiplied by our special number
            (lets call it \(\color{#F09B24}{i}\)) twice, rotates it
            180 degrees, wich is the same as multiplying by -1. So we can work out:
        </p>
        <p class="math">
            $$ \color{#5492f0}{n} \cdot \color{#F09B24}{i} \cdot \color{#F09B24}{i} 
            = \color{#5492f0}{n} \cdot (-1) $$
            $$ \color{#F09B24}{i}^2 = -1 $$
            $$ \color{#F09B24}{i} = \sqrt{-1} $$
        </p>
        <p>
            The normal question now is usually "but what does it mean to take the square
            root of a negative?". But we've already answered this question. It is the 
            answer to our question of rotation.
